# Course Description

This module introduces the student to advanced concepts in modern embedded engineering.
The course concentrates on the architectures used in FPGA/SoC development and associated interfacing.
Exercises are practice-oriented and can be tested on a development board and are designed to ensure practical application of new knowledge.

# Learning objectives

The student will be able to design systems using state machines, soft-core processors, as well as interfacing peripherals to these automatons.
The student will be able to design and commission complete designs in an FPGA in an optimal manner, with optimal computation and optimal data transfers.
Exercises will be completed and applied on an FPGA development board with an Altera Cyclone IV device.
